# Vertical barchart

One barchart which has 4 tabs. Switching a tab means to switch **y** axis.
Maximum number of years rendered is 10. There can be less years rendered.
If less years rendered, then the bars should be centered.
There can be no gaps or skipping, i.e. if there is no data for a year, 
then the bar changes color and I put text "no data" inside the bar.

- **x** - years
- **y** - money for profit, revenue, taxes. number - for employees

**Tab values:**
- Profit
- Revenue
- Taxes
- Employees
